# Multimodal-sentimental-analysis

# this is a project dealing with a problem in NLP called multimodal sentiment analysis.

The main reference is based on Zadeh, Amir, et al. "Tensor fusion network for multimodal sentiment analysis." arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.07250 (2017).

The main project is written in Keras based on Python, and it is also necessary to gain the dataset from the CMU-MOSI. Besides, some packages in python need to be downloaded first as in the instructions of CMU-MOSI.
